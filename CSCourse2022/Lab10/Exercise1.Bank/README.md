2.  Change the access modifiers of BankAccount constructors to internal.
3.	Add overloaded CreateAccount methods to the Bank class that can be used by customers to access accounts and request new accounts.
4.	Make all methods of the Bank class static (and public) and add a private constructor to prevent unnecessary instances of the Bank class.
