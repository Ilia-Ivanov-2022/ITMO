## Exercise 1

In the previous exercise I created structure for describing the bank account. In this exercise the structure is converted to class.<br/>
I declare the class members describing the data with the access modifier private, and create non-static public methods to access the data.<br/>
Next, I test how this class works by creating a bank account object and filling it with data entered by the user (account number and account balance).<br/>
Eventually, the account data information should be displayed on the screen.
