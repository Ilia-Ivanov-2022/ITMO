In the course of the first exercise we created a bacis code which later on was modified with learned constructions <em>enum</em> and <em>struct</em> belonging to value type.<br/>
Version 1 contains a basic code.<br/>
Version 2 is a modification with enum replaced switch.<br/>
Version 3 uses struct.
