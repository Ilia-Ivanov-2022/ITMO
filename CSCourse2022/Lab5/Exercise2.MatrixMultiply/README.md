## Exercise 2

The code of this exercise uses arrays to multiply matrices. It reads four integers from the console and stores them in a 2x2 matrix,<br/>
then reads four more integers and stores them in another 2x2 matrix. Then these matrices are multiplied and the result is stored in a<br/>
third matrix of the same size. The result of matrix multiplication is displayed on the console screen.
